Key learning to practise and/or revise:

Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it
Task:

Practise what we've done this week using JavaScript in the browser:

Fetch information from an API.
Display/Analyse the information in the browser using DOM manipulation/Charts/Maps/Canvas etc. Be creative!
GitHub user toddmotto maintains a HUGE list of links to open APIs on many subjects. We strongly recommend that you avoid APIs which require OAuth authentication. APIs which are listed as requiring an apiKey require a little bit of extra work, but this should be documented by the API itself.
